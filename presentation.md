## üß† Breadth-wise Understanding

### File & Module Structure

The project follows a modular file structure, organizing game components into separate scripts for better maintainability and clarity:

- `main.cpp`: Entry point of the game. Initializes everything.
- `player.cpp / .h`: Manages the player spaceship class.
- `enemy.cpp / .h`: Handles alien logic and movement.
- `missile.cpp / .h`: Bullet mechanics for player and enemy fire.
- `game.cpp / .h`: Manages game loop, collision detection, score updates.
- `Shield.cpp / .h` : Manages destructible shields.


### Game Flow Overview

1. Initialization
- SFML Window created using `sf::RenderWindow`.
- Textures, fonts, sounds are loaded once using AssetManager.
- Entities initialized: Player, enemy grid, shields, etc.

2. Main Game Loop
``` cpp
while (window.isOpen()) {
    handleInput();
    update();
    checkCollision();
    render();
}
```
a. Event Handling
- Polls SFML events using ```window.pollEvent()```.
- Keyboard inputs manage ship movement and missile firing.

b. State Updates
- Player updates movement based on input flags.
- All missiles move upwards each frame.
- Enemies move downwards and may respawn if destroyed or offscreen.
- Game difficulty may scale based on score or enemy count.
- Ensures enemies are removed or respawned, missiles are deleted.

d. Rendering
- ```window.clear()``` followed by drawing all game entities.
- UI: score, level, lives drawn using ```sf::Text```.
- ```window.display()``` to update screen.

3. Game Over Condition
If an enemy reaches the player or bottom edge of the screen, the game ends.  

### Controls and Interaction

## üîç Depth-Wise Analysis

This section explores the internal architecture and engineering choices behind the Space Invaders project. It focuses on the approaches taken during development, the data structures implemented, and key trade-offs considered by the original developer.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Approaches Taken

#### a. Object-Oriented Design (OOP)

The project is structured using **object-oriented principles**. Each core game entity is represented as a C++ class encapsulating its data and behavior:

- **`Player`**: Handles movement, screen boundaries, shooting bullets, and drawing itself.
- **`Enemy`**: Controls movement patterns, collision behavior, and respawning.
- **`Missile`**: Manages bullet direction, velocity, rendering, and off-screen cleanup.

Benefits of OOP in this context:
- **Encapsulation**: Keeps functionality modular and isolated.
- **Reusability**: Enables use of similar logic across multiple objects.
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new features like enemies, power-ups, or effects.

---

#### b. Main Game Loop (Real-Time Frame Control)

The game follows a continuous real-time loop pattern located in main.cpp, responsible for the full lifecycle of each frame.

Loop Responsibilities:
- RenderWindow: A 950x950 `sf::RenderWindow` that handles display and input events.
- Texture Management: Textures for the player ship, enemies, missiles, and shields are loaded 
 and managed using `sf::Texture` and `sf::Sprite`.
- Text Rendering: Game UI such as score, lives, and level are displayed using `sf::Text` objects 
and a loaded `sf::Font` (e.g., `font.ttf`).
- Sound Management:
  - `sf::SoundBuffer` for sound effects (shoot, hit, kill).
  - `sf::Sound` plays effects in response to collisions and user actions.
  - Optional background music via `sf::Music`.

#### c. Event-Driven Input Handling

Input handling is implemented using SFML's own event system with `sf::Event`. Keyboard events are captured and used to move the player ship or trigger actions like firing missiles.

``` cpp
sf::Event event;
while (window.pollEvent(event)) {
    if (event.type == sf::Event::Closed)
        window.close();

    if (event.type == sf::Event::KeyPressed) {
        if (event.key.code == sf::Keyboard::Left)
            player.moveLeft();
        if (event.key.code == sf::Keyboard::Right)
            player.moveRight();
        if (event.key.code == sf::Keyboard::Space)
            player.shoot();
    }
}
```
This approach allows for:
- Immediate and responsive interaction with the user.
- Clean separation between input processing and entity behavior.
- Easily extendable to include new actions (e.g., pause menu with Escape).

####  d. Manual Collision Detection 
 SFML uses `sf::FloatRect::intersects()` for collision detection, typically done using `getGlobalBounds()` from any `sf::Sprite` or `sf::Text`.
cpp
```
if (missiles.getBounds().intersects(enemy.getBounds())) {
    // Missiles hit the enemy
    missiles.setActive(false);
    enemy.destroy();
}
```
Benefits:
- Lightweight: No need for a physics engine, keeping frame rates high.
- Simple: Ideal for sprite-based 2D games with rectangular shapes.
- Flexible: Can be extended with flags for health, destruction effects, etc.


### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Structures Used

#### a. Classes (OOP Abstractions)
The core gameplay revolves around three main C++ classes, each encapsulating data and behavior:
- Player Class
  - Attributes:
    - `sf::Sprite sprite`: The visual representation of the player ship.
    - `sf::Texture texture`: Image used for the player's sprite.
    - `float speed`: Movement speed (typically pixels/frame).
  - Methods:
    - `moveLeft()` and `moveRight()`: Updates position with boundary checks
    - `shoot(std::vector<Missile>& missiles)`: Spawns a missile at player's location
    - `draw(sf::RenderWindow&)`: Draws player to screen

- Enemy Class
  - Attributes:
    - `sf::Sprite sprite`: Visual for each enemy.
    - `sf::Texture texture`: Texture shared across enemy grid.
    - `float speed`: Movement rate (changes on level progression).
  - Methods:
    - `move(Direction dir)`: Moves the enemy downward
    - `draw(sf::RenderWindow&)`: Renders enemy on screen
    - `respawn()`: Repositions off-screen enemy back into formation.

- Missile Class
  - Attributes:
    - `sf::RectangleShape shape`: Graphical representation of missile (or could be a sprite).
    - `float velocity`: Upward speed for player missiles, downward for enemies.
    - `bool active`: Used to check if missile should be updated or drawn.
  - Methods:
    - `update()`: Moves missile each frame according to velocity.
    - `isOffScreen()`: Checks if bullet has exited screen
    - `draw(sf::RenderWindow&)`: Renders Missile if active
This abstraction allows:
- Better encapsulation with `sf::Sprite` & `sf::Texture`.
- Easier to debug and maintain modular code.
- Extendable for effects like animations, scaling, rotation.

#### b. Vectors (Collections of Game Entities)

The game uses C++ STL containers to manage dynamic lists of objects:

```cpp
std::vector<Enemy> enemies;
std::vector<Missile> missiles;
```
- enemies: Stores all active enemy objects, updated and drawn every frame.
- bullets: Stores bullets fired by the player. Each bullet is updated and drawn independently.
- Inactive/expired bullets are removed after collision or going off-screen using erase-remove idiom or a boolean flag.

Benefits of std::vector:
- Dynamic memory allocation
- Easy iteration with range-based for loops
- Fast access by index

#### c. SFML Bounding Boxes for Collision Detection

- Each entity (missile, enemy, ship) uses getGlobalBounds() to get its AABB for collision detection.
``` cpp
 if (missiles.getBounds().intersects(enemy.getBounds())) {
    // Collision response
 }
  ```
- `sf::FloatRect` returned by `getGlobalBounds()` is used with `.intersects()`.
- Ideal for fast collision checks in 2D arcade games.

Why AABB in SFML?
- Simple and efficient.
- Works well for sprite-based axis-aligned shapes.
- Can be extended to pixel-perfect if needed later.

#### d. Assets: Images and Textures

Instead of using raw pointers, SFML uses RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) for managing graphical and audio resources.
``` cpp
sf::Texture playerTexture;
playerTexture.loadFromFile("assets/player.png");

sf::Sprite playerSprite;
playerSprite.setTexture(playerTexture);
```
- For rendering:
  `window.draw(playerSprite);`
- For sounds and music
  ``` cpp
  sf::SoundBuffer buffer;
  buffer.loadFromFile("assets/shoot.wav");

  sf::Sound shootSound;
  shootSound.setBuffer(buffer);
  shootSound.play();
  ```
- For fonts and text
  ``` cpp
  sf::Font font;
  font.loadFromFile("assets/font.ttf");

  sf::Text scoreText;
  scoreText.setFont(font);
  scoreText.setString("Score: 0");
  scoreText.setCharacterSize(24);
  scoreText.setFillColor(sf::Color::White);
  ```

## Collision Detection Improvements in main.cpp
``` cpp
bool checkCollision(const sf::Sprite& sprite1, const sf::Sprite& sprite2) {
    return sprite1.getGlobalBounds().intersects(sprite2.getGlobalBounds());
}
```
- Checks if two SFML sprites intersect using global bounds
- Returns True if sprites overlap
- Replaces manual position checks with SFML's built-in bounding box collision

| Collision Type           | Old Check                       |     New Check                       |
